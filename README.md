Hey üëãüèº I'm Marco, a passionate Full-Stack Ruby on Rails developer and committed open-source contributor!

I have been part of the Hotwire and StimulusReflex contributors teams where I have been pushing the boundaries of what's possible with real-time server-side-rendered web applications using the [HTML-over-the-wire (Hotwire)](https://hotwired.dev) approach.

I have actively open-sourced, maintained, and contributed to several key libraries within the Hotwire and Ruby on Rails ecosystem, including:

[Herb](https://github.com/marcoroth/herb), [Stimulus](https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus), [Turbo](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo), [Turbo Rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails), [Turbo Power](https://github.com/marcoroth/turbo_power), [Turbo Power Rails](https://github.com/marcoroth/turbo_power-rails), [Turbo Morph](https://github.com/marcoroth/turbo-morph), [Turbo LSP](https://github.com/marcoroth/turbo-lsp), [Turbo Ruby](https://github.com/marcoroth/turbo-ruby), [StimulusReflex](https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex), [CableReady](https://github.com/stimulusreflex/cable_ready), [Stimulus Use](https://github.com/stimulus-use/stimulus-use), [Stimulus LSP](https://github.com/marcoroth/stimulus-lsp), [Stimulus Parser](https://github.com/marcoroth/stimulus-parser), [Phlex](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex), [Current.js](https://github.com/marcoroth/current.js)


Additionally, I have also built a few open-source applications and projects:
- [rubyconferences.org](https://rubyconferences.org) - A website for listing upcoming Ruby events such as conferences, meetups, and CFPs.
- [rubyvideo.dev](https://rubyvideo.dev) - On a mission to index all Ruby conferences.
- [Phlexing](https://phlexing.fun) - An app and [gem](https://github.com/marcoroth/phlexing) for converting ERB to [Phlex](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex)
- [Hotwire.io](https://hotwire.io) - A community-driven documentation hub for Hotwire.
- [Hotwire Weekly](https://hotwire.io/newsletter) - A weekly newsletter focused on Hotwire.
- [Boxdrop](https://github.com/marcoroth/boxdrop) - An app that demonstrates the power of StimulusReflex
- [gem.sh](https://github.com/marcoroth/gem.sh) - Beautiful documentation for any Ruby gem.
